Library of common functionality and widely-useful tweaks for Minecraft modding.

The goal of this branch will be to port this library from Scala to Java and drop Scala entirely. This will be vital to porting this library to each consecutive version of Minecraft because it will allow those without Scala knowledge or experience to be able to contribute and learn from this library.
